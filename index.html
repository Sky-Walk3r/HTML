        <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p>I had been staring out of my window for about an hour now. On my desk, lying between copies of
        <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientists</i>, and all the other scientific journals my work had appeared
        in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been my favourite book since college,
        and the longer i spent in these four walls the more i felt i needed to be free.</p>
        <p>I had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote
        proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although many
        considered my pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama <abbr title="DeoxyriboNucleic Acid">
        DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, I <em>did</em> think i had something batter to do.</p>
